# üïµÔ∏è Scotland Crime Data Analysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of crime data reported in various regions of Scotland, using Python and data visualization libraries. The aim is to uncover patterns, identify regions with the highest and lowest crime rates, and provide insights that could be useful for law enforcement and policymakers.

## üìä Overview

The dataset used in this analysis includes reported crimes categorized under **"All Offences"** across Scottish local authority areas. The analysis focuses on:

- Identifying cities with the **highest and lowest number of reported crimes**
- Visualizing the distribution of crimes geographically
- Highlighting significant variations in crime rates across different Scottish regions

## üìç Key Findings

### üîº Top Ten Highest Crime Cities
The top ten cities with the highest number of reported crimes are:

1. **Glasgow City** *(Highest)*
2. City of Edinburgh  
3. North Lanarkshire  
4. Fife  
5. Aberdeen City  
6. South Lanarkshire  
7. Dundee City  
8. West Lothian  
9. Renfrewshire  
10. Falkirk  

> üìå **Glasgow City** tops the chart with a significantly higher crime count compared to other regions.

### üîΩ Top Ten Lowest Crime Cities
The cities with the lowest number of reported crimes are:

- **Orkney Islands**
- **Na h-Eileanan Siar**
- **Shetland Islands**
- East Renfrewshire
- East Dunbartonshire
- Midlothian
- Inverclyde

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The analysis reveals **considerable variation in crime levels** across Scottish cities. This variation emphasizes the importance of **region-specific strategies** for crime prevention and public safety. High-crime areas may benefit from targeted law enforcement efforts, while low-crime areas can serve as case studies for successful community safety practices.
